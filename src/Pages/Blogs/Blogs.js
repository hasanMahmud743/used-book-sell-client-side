          <span>Que:01</span> Difference between SQL and NoSQL{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl p-4 ">
          <span className="font-bold">Ans:</span> From analysts and engineers to
          IT decision makers, many are familiar with Relational Database
          Management Systems (RDBMS) and the Structured Query Language (SQL)
          used to interact with them. While these terms refer to a decades-old
          paradigm which remains a wide standard, today the sheer variety and
          depth of database systems can be dizzying. What’s more, rising volumes
          of unstructured data, availability of storage and processing power,
          and evolving analytic requirements have generated interest in
          fundamentally different technologies.{" "}

          <span>Que:02</span> What is JWT, and how does it work?
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl p-4 ">
          <span className="font-bold">Ans:</span> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an
          open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between
          parties as JSON object. It is compact, readable and digitally signed
          using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity
          Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be
          verified by other parties involved. The purpose of using JWT is not to
          hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed
          and encoded, not encrypted. JWT is a token based stateless
          authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless
          session, server doesn't have to completely rely on a
          datastore(database) to save session information.{" "}

          <span>Que:03</span> What is the difference between javascript and
          NodeJS?

          <span className="font-bold">Ans:</span> <br />
          <span className="font-bold"> Node: </span>
          For executing JavaScript on the server, Node.js is a bridge,
          open-source Js runtime environment. JavaScript code can now execute
          outside of the browser, thanks to Node.js. Node.js has many components
          and is primarily used for web development. It may run on various
          operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. It provides a
          cross-platform runtime environment for developing highly scalable
          server-side JavaScript applications with event-driven, non-blocking
          (asynchronous) I/O. <br /> <br />
          <span className="font-bold"> Javascript: </span> Javascript is a
          simple object-oriented programming language for building interactive
          HTML pages. JavaScript is also commonly used in the development of
          games and mobile applications. The program can only be executed and
          run in an internet browser because it is interpreted as scripting. To
          run and execute the code outside the browser, we can utilize Node.js.{" "}

        <p className="text-2xl font-bold p-4">
          <span>Que:04</span> How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the
          same time?{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl p-4 ">
          <span className="font-bold">Ans:</span> NodeJS receives multiple
          client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with
          the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop
          which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.
          EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process
          the request without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself
          process the request and sends the response back to the client by
          itself. But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly
          using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads module.
